3.12: Segment Data Processing and Storage Based on Sensitivity
==================================
Segment data processing and storage, based on the sensitivity of the data. Do not process sensitive data on enterprise assets intended for lower sensitivity data.

* Safeguard 12.4: Establish and Maintain Architecture Diagram(s)

Inputs
------
#. :code:`GV12`: Sensitive Data Inventory
#. :code:`GV4`: Enterprise Network Architecture Documentation

Assumptions
----------
#. An asset’s overall sensitivity level should be the highest sensitivity level of the data it stores/processes/transmits. If a system contains any sensitive information, that asset should be treated accordingly, and should be properly separated from networks or network segments that don’t have a need to access that type of sensitive information.

Operations
----------
#. For each item in :code:`GV12` identify the assets that store, process, or transmit sensitive data (M1)
#. Use the output of Operation 1 and :code:`GV4` to identify networks/VLANs connected to the assets
	#. Identify and enumerate any instances of properly seperated assets from less sensitive networks (M2)
	#. Identify and enumerate any instances of improperly seperated assets from less sensitive networks (M3)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of assets storing, processing, or transmitting sensitive data
* M2 = Count of sensitive assets properly seperated from less sensitive networks 
* M3 = Count of sensitive assets improperly seperated from less sensitive networks
