CIS Control 15: Service Provider Management
=======================================================

Develop a process to evaluate service providers who hold sensitive data, or are responsible for an enterprise’s critical IT platforms or processes, to ensure these providers are protecting those platforms and data appropriately.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

In our modern, connected world, enterprises rely on vendors and partners to help manage their data or rely on third-party infrastructure for core applications or functions.

There have been numerous examples where third-party breaches have significantly impacted an enterprise; for example, as early as the late 2000s, payment cards were compromised after attackers infiltrated smaller third-party vendors in the retail industry. More recent examples include ransomware attacks that impact an enterprise indirectly, due to one of their service providers being locked down, causing disruption to business. Or worse, if directly connected, a ransomware attack could encrypt data on the main enterprise.

Most data security and privacy regulations require their protection extend to third-party service providers, such as with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Business Associate agreements in healthcare, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) requirements for the financial industry, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) Cyber Essentials. Third-party trust is a core Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) function, as risks that are not managed within the enterprise are transferred to entities outside the enterprise.

While reviewing the security of third-parties has been a task performed for decades, there is not a universal standard for assessing security; and, many service providers are being audited by their customers multiple times a month, causing impacts to their own productivity. This is because every enterprise has a different “checklist” or set of standards to grade the service provider. There are only a few industry standards, such as in finance, with the Shared Assessments program, or in higher education, with their Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit (HECVAT). Insurance companies selling cybersecurity policies also have their own measurements.

While an enterprise might put a lot of scrutiny into large cloud or application hosting companies because they are hosting their email or critical business applications, smaller firms are often a greater risk. Often times, a third-party service provider contracts with additional parties to provide other plugins or services, such as when a third-party uses a fourth-party platform or product to support the main enterprise.
