CIS Control 12: Network Infrastructure Management
=======================================================

Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report, correct) network devices, in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable network services and access points.

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Secure network infrastructure is an essential defense against attacks. This includes an appropriate security architecture, addressing vulnerabilities that are, often times, introduced with default settings, monitoring for changes, and reassessment of current configurations. Network infrastructure includes devices such as physical and virtualized gateways, firewalls, wireless access points, routers, and switches.

Default configurations for network devices are geared for ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use – not security. Potential default vulnerabilities include open services and ports, default accounts and passwords (including service accounts), support for older vulnerable protocols, and pre-installation of unneeded software. Attackers search for vulnerable default settings, gaps or inconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers, and switches and use those holes to penetrate defenses. They exploit flaws in these devices to gain access to networks, redirect traffic on a network, and intercept data while in transmission.

Network security is a constantly changing environment that necessitates regular re-evaluation of architecture diagrams, configurations, access controls, and allowed traffic flows. Attackers take advantage of network device configurations becoming less secure over time as users demand exceptions for specific business needs. Sometimes the exceptions are deployed, but not removed when they are no longer applicable to the business’s needs. In some cases, the security risk of an exception is neither properly analyzed nor measured against the associated business need and can change over time.
