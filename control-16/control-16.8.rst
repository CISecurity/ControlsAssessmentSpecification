Dependencies
------------
* None

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV1`: Enterprise Asset Inventory

Operations
----------
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV1` to identify and enumerate productions systems (M1)
#. For each production system identified in Operation 1, use Input 1 :code:`GV1` to identify if at least one non-production system exists for the system
	#. Identify and enumerate productions systems with at least one non-production system (M2)
	#. Identify and enumerate productions systems without a non-production system (M3)

Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of production systems
* M2 = Count of production systems with a non-production system to complement 
* M3 = Count of productions systems without a non-production system to complement
