16.3: Perform Root Cause Analysis on Security Vulnerabilities
=========================================================
Perform root cause analysis on security vulnerabilities. When reviewing vulnerabilities, root cause analysis is the task of evaluating underlying issues that create vulnerabilities in code, and allows development teams to move beyond just fixing individual vulnerabilities as they arise.

Dependencies
------------
* Safeguard 16.2: Establish and Maintain a Process to Accept and Address Software Vulnerabilities

Inputs
-----------
#. Root Cause Analysis Process
#. Vulnerabilities addressed over the last twelve months

Operations
----------
#. Determine whether Input 1 exists within the enterprise
	#. If Input 1 exists, M1 = 1
	#. If Input 1 does not exist, M1 = 0
#. Review Input 1 and dermine whether it includes, at a minimum, the following components: categorization of vulnerabilities, guidance for how lessons learned are incorporated into the development process 
	#. For each component included in the process, assign a value of 1.  Sum all values. (M2)
#. For each vulnerability addressed over the last twelve months, assess whether the root cause analysis process was followed
	#. Identify and enumerate vulnerabilities for which the process was followed (M4)
	#. Identify and enumerate vulnerabilities for which the process was not followed (M5)


Measures
--------
* M1 = Output of Operation 1
* M2 = Count of components included in the process
* M3 = Count of Input 2
* M4 = Count of vulnerabilities for which root cause analysis was conducted
* M5 = Count of vulnerabilities for which root cause analysis was not conducted  

Metrics
-------
* If M1 is 0, this safeguard receives a failing score. The other metrics don't apply.
