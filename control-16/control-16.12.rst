Dependencies
------------
* Safeguard 2.1: Establish and Maintain a Software Inventory

Inputs
-----------
#. :code:`GV5`: Authorized Software Inventory

Operations
----------
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV5` to identify and enumerate in-house developed software (M1)
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV5` to identify static analysis tools
#. For each software identified in Operation 1, determine if it is verified by a static tool identified in Operation 2
	#. Identify and enumerate software verified by a static tool (M2)
	#. Identify and enumerate software not verified by a static tool (M3)
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV5` to identify dynamic analysis tools
#. For each software identified in Operation 1, determine if it is verified by a dynamic tool identified in Operation 4
	#. Identify and enumerate software verified by a dynamic tool (M4)
	#. Identify and enumerate software not verified by a dynamic tool (M5)
#. Use Input 1 :code:`GV5` to identify interactive analysis tools
#. For each software identified in Operation 1, determine if it is verified by an interactive tool identified in Operation 6
	#. Identify and enumerate software verified by an interactive tool (M6)
	#. Identify and enumerate software not verified by an interactive tool (M7)
Measures
--------
* M1 = Count of in-house developed software
* M2 = Count of in-house developed software verified by a static analysis tool
* M3 = Count of in-house developed software not verified by a static analysis tool
* M4 = Count of in-house developed software verified by a dynamic analysis tool
* M5 = Count of in-house developed software not verified by a dynamic analysis tool
* M6 = Count of in-house developed software verified by an interactive analysis tool
* M7 = Count of in-house developed software not verified by an interactive analysis tool

Metrics

	  - :code:`M2 / M1`

Dynamic Analysis Tool Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
	  - | The percentage of in-house developed software verified by a
	    | dynamic analysis tool
	* - **Calculation**
	  - :code:`M4 / M1`

Interactive Analysis Tool Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

	* - **Metric**
